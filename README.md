Simple Task Manager I made a few years ago to bypass the restrictions made on some computer systems.

Nearly all systems I've been on with command prompt restrictions only prevent the ".bat" extention. However, the alternative extention is ".cmd" and seems to work (at least for me)

To use the script, open it up and find the process you want to kill. Have fun
